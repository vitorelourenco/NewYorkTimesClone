            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young 
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment 
            at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing 
            far beyond the world of known physics.<br>

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles 
            that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered 
            what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the 
            presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special 
            energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than 
            the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.<br>
            
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
            uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
            ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles 
            were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.<br>
            
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a 
            double box around it.<br>
            
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they 
            had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known 
            undramatically as inflation, looked right.
